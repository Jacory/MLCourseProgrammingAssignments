# MLCourseProgrammingAssignments
Programming Assignments of coursera Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng from Stanford University. The course's website link is https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info 

All the files are exactly the same with original, but with the excersice code completed. The instruction documents, which are pdf format, are also included in this repository.

**Note: you should use this repository just as a reference. Complete the programming assignments by yourself is the best way to learn and practice. I don't want anyone to cheat in the course, as you will learn nothing.**

## machine-learning-ex1
Linear Regression

## machine-learning-ex2
Logistic Regression

## machine-learning-ex3
Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

## machine-learning-ex4
Neural Networks Learning

## machine-learning-ex5
Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance.

There's one thing to note: when compute error_train and error_val for learning curve and validtion curve, the lambda value passed to the LinearRegCostFunction should be 0.

## machine-learning-ex6

Support Vector Machines

## machine-learning-ex7

K-means and PCA algorithm.
